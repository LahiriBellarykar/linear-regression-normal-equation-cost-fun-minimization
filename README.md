# linear-regression-normal-equation-cost-fun-minimization

Hi All, Machine learning enthusiast out there. Normal equation is another way of finding fitting model and fairly good values for hypothesis. I have taken some effort here to demonstrate Normal equation in case of the linear regression problem. To make it really easier I have added a Jupyter notebook, which can be readily used on your machine and take a look at my work. (If you want help setup Jupyter notebook. here it is https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) I am really willing to hear back from all of you. Your comments and suggestions are most welcomed. Feel free to reach me on LinkedIn
